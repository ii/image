#   - Dropped Ignition glue, that can be injected into platform.cfg
# petitboot doesn't support -e and doesn't support an empty path part

  # fcct currently creates /boot RAID with superblock 1.0, which allows
  # component partitions to be read directly as filesystems.  This is
  # necessary because transposefs doesn't yet rerun grub2-install on BIOS,
  # so GRUB still expects /boot to be a partition on the first disk.
  #
  # There are two consequences:
  # 1. On BIOS and UEFI, the search command might pick an individual RAID
  #    component, but we want it to use the full RAID in case there are bad
  #    sectors etc.  The undocumented --hint option is supposed to support
  #    this sort of override, but it doesn't seem to work, so we set $boot
  #    directly.
  # 2. On BIOS, the "normal" module has already been loaded from an
  #    individual RAID component, and $prefix still points there.  We want
  #    future module loads to come from the RAID, so we reset $prefix.
  #    (On UEFI, the stub grub.cfg has already set $prefix properly.)
